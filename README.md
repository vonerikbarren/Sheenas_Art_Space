## Latest Updates:
- 05.15.22 - Imported WebSpace.js Template A for building and development
- 05.17.22 - Worked on Building About me for project

## Project Focus:
- To give the user an opportunity to immerse themselves in a 3D environment to utilize 2nd, 3rd, and 4th dimensional Menus and to utilize space for moving, organizing, and understanding for the purpose of establishing a relational reality. 

## Main Features
- 2D Menu - Main Menu or Start Menu
- 2D Side Menu - For Structural or Functional Components within the WebSpace
- 3D Menu - For viewing 2D Objects in the 3D space and organizational purposes.

- Structural 3D Components - For viewing contents of webSpace
- Functional 3D Components - For the user to interact with the 3D environment

- Stationary Mode - For start Menu and side menu,
- Space Movement Mode - For Traversing the 3D environment,
- Action Mode - For interacting with 2D, 3D, or 4D objects within the 3D space.


# How Application Works
1st - Stationary Mode - For stationary functions, operations, or processes.

2nd - Space Traversal Mode - Clicking in application then moving user or items in 3D environment with side bar.

3rd - Interacting with SpaceWindows in Action Mode requires the user to press escape which takes the user back to the stationary mode with the main menu, however there is a 5sec window to interact with the environment by clicking. During this small window which is intentional, the user can interact with an object within the 3D space. 



## Directions
- To start - Click On middle of screen to enter
- To interact with 3D environemnt use w,s,a,d, respectively or arrows for movement options
